                <p> This vignette explores how logistic regression and random forest models can classify household density categories (urban, suburban, exurban, rural) using data from the 2010-2012 California Household Travel Survey (CHTS). </p>

                <p>
                    Misinformation has rapidly become a widespread concern. Fake news is easier than ever to circulate due to social media and the dismantling of fact-checking systems.
                    This project aims to create a model that can distinguish between fake and real news.

                    The objective of this project is to create a bot capable of playing in pokernow.club tournaments with solid poker fundamentals
                    by using data of past games from the pokernow.club website.

                <h2> Protein Crystal Image Classifier </h2>
                <p>
                    Protein crystallography helps scientists understand the structure of proteins, which is important for things like drug discovery. 
                    To study these structures, researchers need to know when a protein has formed a crystal so they can examine it using X-rays. 
                    Right now, identifying crystals in images is often done by hand, which is slow and can be inaccurate.
                    This capstone project, conducted in collaboration with Stanford SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, aims to build a model that can automatically classify crystallization well images into four categories: Clear, Crystal, Precipitate, and Other.
