                    <h2> About me </h2>
                    <p> Hi, I’m Shirley! I recently graduated from the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), 
                        where I double majored in <strong>Statistics & Data Science and Psychological & Brain Sciences</strong>. 
                        I’m fascinated by the intersection of numbers and decision-making—how data shapes the way we understand people, 
                        markets, and behavior.
                    <p> Throughout my academic and research experience, I’ve worked on projects involving data cleaning, 
                        experimental design, and statistical analysis, often in settings that require strong attention to detail, 
                        collaboration, and clear communication. I’m skilled in tools like Python, R, SQL, SAS, and Excel, 
                        and I’ve worked with both structured and unstructured datasets.</p>
                    <p> I’m especially interested in using data to improve outcomes in both business and healthcare—whether 
                        it’s helping organizations make smarter decisions or uncovering insights that support public well-being. 
                        I’m motivated by work that not only solves problems but also creates positive, real-world impact.</p>
                    <p> Beyond academics, I love cooking and tasting food from different places. I also enjoy rock climbing 
                        and traveling—experiences that help me explore new perspectives and challenge myself. I’m excited about all the 
                        places I have yet to visit and the experiences I have yet to discover!</p>
